# Traffic Light Simulation in Unity 🚦
Engineering project for Academic purposes. Simulation allow to test diffrent options of trafic light manage system (included adaptive system with fuzzy logic), 
user can change number of vehicles created on each lane. Simulaiton has statistics system which allow to test diffrent trafic light management systems
## Features
1. 🚦 Real-time simulation of traffic lights.

2. 🚗 Dynamic vehicle spawning on each lane.

3. 📊 Built-in statistics system to measure traffic flow efficiency.

4. 🧠 Support for adaptive traffic light control using fuzzy logic.

5. ⚙️ User-configurable traffic density for testing various scenarios.

6. 🕹️ 3D visualization of vehicle and light behavior in Unity.
